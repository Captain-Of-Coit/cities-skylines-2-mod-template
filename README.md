# Requirements

- [Cities: Skylines 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/) (duh)
- [BepInEx 5.4.22](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) or later
- (Optional) [dotnet-script](https://github.com/dotnet-script/dotnet-script) (for `rename.csx` helper script)
    - Installation `dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script`

# Usage

- Create a new repository based on this one
- Clone your new repository to your computer
- Uncomment and update the `Cities2_Location` variable in `MyCoolMod.csproj`
- Run `make build`

After running the last command, the mod should be automatically copied to your game directory,
so launching the game should include running the mod you just started :)

# Renaming your project

You can leverage the helper script in `scripts/rename.csx` in order to replace "MyCoolMod" with whatever you want to name your project. Usage:

```
$ dotnet script scripts\rename.csx "MyCoolMod" "AnotherModIMade"
```

# Set license details

You'll need to update `LICENSE` with the correct details for `<Year>` and `<Author>`, and change "MyCoolMod" to your mod name if you haven't already.

# Incrementing version number

- Update `.csproj` file with new version number
- Update `thunderstore.toml` file with new version number
- Update `CHANGELOG` to describe the changes you've made between this and previous version
- Commit version bump
- Do a git tag with the new version number
    - `git tag -a v0.2.0 -m v0.2.0`
- Push your changes + tags
    - `git push origin master --tags`

# CI / GitHub Actions - Setup

In order to get the CI/GitHub Actions workflow to work, you have to do a couple of things.

- Create a new private repository with all the game DLLs that you require for building your mod
- Create a new GitHub Personal Access Token ("PAT") that has only READ access to the created private repository
- Create a new secret variable in GitHub Actions called `GH_PAT` that has your PAT with read access to the private repository

Now the CI job should work as expected :)

# Regarding BepInEx version 5 (Stable) VS 6 (Alpha/Unstable/Nightly)

Currently, this mod template defaults to building against BepInEx version 6 (unstable pre-release). If you'd like to instead use Stable BepInEx version 5, you can run the build like this:

```
$ make build BEPINEX_VERSION=5
```

In order to run code only for one BepInEx version, you can do something like this:

```
#if BEPINEX_V6
    using BepInEx.Unity.Mono;
#endif
```

That would only run `using BepInEx.Unity.Mono` when you're building the project for BepInEx 6. Add in a `else` if you want to do something different when it's version 5.
