# Cities: Skylines 2 - C# Mod template

This repository template allows you to get started with Cities: Skylines 2 modding easily.

# Requirements

- [Cities: Skylines 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/) (duh)
- [BepInEx-Unity.Mono-win-x64-6.0.0-be.674+82077ec](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be)

# Usage

- Create a new repository based on this one
- Clone your new repository to your computer
- Uncomment and update the `Cities2_Location` variable in `MyCoolMod.csproj`
- Run `make build`

After running the last command, the mod should be automatically copied to your game directory,
so launching the game should include running the mod you just started :)
